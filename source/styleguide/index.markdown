Styleguide
==========
This document is a guide to the mark-up styles used throughout the site.

Sections
--------
The main page header of this guide is an <code>h1</code> element. Any header elements may include links, as depicted in the example.

The secondary header above is an <code>h2</code> element, which may be used for any form of important page-level header. More than one may be used per page. Consider using an <code>h2</code> unless you need a header level of less importance, or as a sub-header to an existing <code>h2</code> element.

### Third-Level Header
The header above is an <code>h3</code> element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the <code>h2</code> header in a document hierarchy.

#### Fourth-Level Header
The header above is an <code>h4</code> element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the <code>h3</code> header in a document hierarchy.

##### Fifth-Level Header
The header above is an <code>h5</code> element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the <code>h4</code> header in a document hierarchy.

###### Sixth-Level Header
The header above is an <code>h6</code> element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the <code>h5</code> header in a document hierarchy.

Grouping content
----------------

### Paragraphs
All paragraphs are wrapped in <code>p</code> tags. Additionally, <code>p</code> elements can be wrapped with a <code>blockquote</code> element if the <code>p</code> element is indeed a quote. Historically, <code>blockquote</code> has been used purely to force indents, but this is now achieved using CSS. Reserve <code>blockquote</code> for quotes.

### Horizontal rule
The <code>hr</code> element represents a paragraph-level thematic break, e.g. a scene change in a story, or a transition to another topic within a section of a reference book. The following extract from <cite>Pandora’s Star</cite> by Peter F. Hamilton shows two paragraphs that precede a scene change and the paragraph that follows it:

<div class="example">
Dudley was ninety-two, in his second life, and fast approaching time for another rejuvenation. Despite his body having the physical age of a standard fifty-year-old, the prospect of a long degrading campaign within academia was one he regarded with dread. For a supposedly advanced civilization, the Intersolar Commonwearth could be appallingly backward at times, not to mention cruel.

<i>Maybe it won’t be that bad</i>, he told himself. The lie was comforting enough to get him through the rest of the night’s shift.

The Carlton AllLander drove Dudley home just after dawn. Like the astronomer, the vehicle was old and worn, but perfectly capable of doing its job. It had a cheap diesel engine, common enough on a semi-frontier world like Gralmond, although its drive array was a thoroughly modern photoneural processor. With its high suspension and deep-tread tyres it could plough along the dirt track to the observatory in all weather and seasons, including the metre-deep snow of Gralmond’s winters.
