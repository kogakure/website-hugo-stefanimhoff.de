There it lay in my mailbox: My voucher copy of the current issue 07/2010 of the Webstandards-Magazin. This is a premiere for me because I wrote my first article for the Webstandards-Magazin.

It should be three pages long, now it has almost become five. It simply was not possible to put all the fascination for Django, code samples and graphics into so little space. But the editors-in-chief of [Webstandards-Magazine](https://www.screengui.de/) Ansgar Hein and Jörg Morsbach were very accommodating and gave me more space. Thank you again for that! I would also like to thank the diligent helpers who have checked my article for content or spelling errors.

The article did not become this: a tutorial with step-by-step instructions. But there are plenty of other good places on the internet for that. I wanted to clarify with my article, why I like Django so much and have stayed true to this web framework for more than four years, which is not self-evident, because I am hard to please. I have used <cite>TextPattern</cite>, <cite>WordPress</cite>, <cite>CodeIgniter</cite>, <cite>ExpressionEngine</cite>, <cite>ModX</cite>, <cite> Symphony</cite> and some web frameworks and CMS, but only since I use Django, I really have the feeling that I control and understand everything on my website.

Django gives me clean, easy-to-read Python code that even full-fledged beginner programmers can read. Since I changed my martial arts magazine [kogakure.de](https://www.kogakure.de/) to Django in May 2008, I am Djangonaut. I would like to implement many more projects with Django, but unfortunately the distribution of Django is still not as big as Ruby on Rails or various Java frameworks - **completely unjustly**.

Unfortunately, I did not manage to publish the article at the same time of switching to Django, because of missing time … But I work without pressure. In the meantime, ExpressionEngine is still doing its job, which is also a highly recommended system, I hope you like my article and bring more to the Django community.

The <cite>Webstandards-Magazin</cite>, _Issue 07/2010_ with the topic _Tools_ will be published on **24.09.2010** in the station and airport bookstores for the price of **7,80 €** or by subscription for four issues per year for 28 €. You can find my article on pages 83-87: <cite>Einstieg in Django. Vielseitig und leistungsstark: Vorstellung des Python-Frameworks für anspruchsvolle Webanwendungen</cite>.
