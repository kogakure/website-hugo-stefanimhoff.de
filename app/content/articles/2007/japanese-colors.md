During a visit to the art exhibition <cite>Japan and the West</cite> in the [Art Museum Wolfsburg](https://www.kunstmuseum-wolfsburg.de/), I was able to get my hands on a wonderful book about the traditional, Japanese colors.

In the museum shop I was able to buy the book <cite>[The Traditional Colors of Japan](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/4894445786/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=4894445786&linkCode=as2&tag=kogakurede-21)</cite>, which is in Japanese. In addition to a full color palette of 250 colors, it also contains an exact indication of RGB, CMYK and other information.

Each page of the book shows three colors that are always juxtaposed with one or more wonderful photos. The photos show the traditional use in kimono, samurai armor, monk clothing or nature.

I took the time to create the RGB palette with the correct color names as Adobe Exchange file (ase). This color palette can be used in Photoshop or Illustrator.
