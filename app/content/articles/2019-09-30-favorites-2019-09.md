## Quotes

_Jordan B Peterson_ in an interview with _Dave Rubin_ talking about speech police around the world as a disconcerting trend. He explains that we as a society need to be able to transcent the hardship of life with comedy. Comedians are people who push the edge of what’s acceptable. And if we start to prosecute comedians for jokes it’s a warning that our society goes in a dangerous direction:

<blockquote>
  <p>“If the king is such a tyrant that he kills his jester, then you know that the evil king is in charge.”</p>

_Ernest Hemingway_ writing in a letter to _Dorothy Connable_, as he was warning her about _Charles Fenton_, who spread misinformation about Hemingway’s life:
