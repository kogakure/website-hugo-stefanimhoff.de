## TV Shows

- [Annihilation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2798920/) ([Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80206300)) – I rewatched the Netflix movie, because after reading Lovecraft’s _The Colour out of Space_, I realised that the writers have written in parts—without intention—a nice adaptation of the story.
- [Mad Men](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0804503/) ([Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/70136135)) – I started rewatching this fantastic tv show. It won 5 Golden Globes and 132 other awards. It’s story spans over multiple years and is so deep and stacked with so many layers of interpretation.
- [Mindhunter](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5290382/), Season 2 ([Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80114855)) – I started watching the second season of this Netflix tv show about the FBI unit that started interviewing serial killers in the 1970s to understand and prevent these crimes.
- [Glow](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5770786/) ([Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80114988)) – A colleague recommended this funny TV show to me. It’s about a group of women who become wrestlers in Los Angeles during the 1980s.
- [Dave Chappelle: Sticks & Stones](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10810424/s) ([Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/81140577)) – Very funny, political incorrect, and right to the heart of every virtue signaller and social justice warrior.

## Music

- [Deichkind: Keine Party](https://open.spotify.com/album/6jVmvHcCU4RpUI8Gsfhw7X?si=CPvh1vGUQ3KV-4DBdTTFZg) – I really enjoyed the new song from the Hamburg Hip-Hop Band Deichkind. The [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH1poPSIvOk) is really funny. This dance move will prevail.

## Books

- [The Complete Fiction of H. P. Lovecraft](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44065867-the-complete-fiction-of-h-p-lovecraft) ([Amazon](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07NWN6KD6?ie=UTF8&tag=kogakurede-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=6742&creativeASIN=B07NWN6KD6)) – I’m currently halfway through this book and really love Lovecraft Horror.
