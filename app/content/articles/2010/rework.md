Today, I recommend a book that I just finished recently and read a second time: <cite>Rework</cite> by _Jason Fried_ and _David Heinemeier Hansson_.

I have long been a great believer in the philosophy of simplicity which is cultivated by <cite><del>37signals</del> <ins>Basecamp</ins></cite> so successfully. Already their first (free) book [Getting Real](https://basecamp.com/books/getting-real) (also as [paperback version](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0578012812?ie=UTF8&tag=stefanimhoffde-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=0578012812)) I read with great interest.

But with <cite>Rework</cite> they have achieved a true masterpiece. Not without reason it is a bestseller in the US and the UK. Critics and CEO praise the book in the highest terms (Seth Godin, John Maeda, Chris Anderson, and others).

And unlike the rather simple <cite>Getting Real</cite>, there’s <cite>Rework</cite> as a hardcover version, in a very attractive binding and with fantastic drawings by Mike Rohde.

The [official website](https://basecamp.com/books/rework) of the book offers a sample excerpt, three funny promotional videos, tons of words of praise and quotes, photos of enthusiastic readers and a full chapter overview.

<cite>Getting Real</cite> was especially created for programmers who want to successfully complete a project - <cite>Rework</cite>, on the other hand, is suitable for every employee and employer, from the managing director to the administrator.

With just 21,000 words, the book offers valuable tips for getting a productive and fulfilling working day. Of course, much of this is not new (some points have already been found in <cite>Getting Real</cite>), and none of this has been invented by <cite><del>37signals</del> <ins>Basecamp</ins></cite>, but so far I’ve read so many good tips nowhere else in such brevity and conciseness.

And for the very ready lazy people there is even an [audiobook version](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0307704513?ie=UTF8&tag=stefanimhoffde-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=0307704513).
