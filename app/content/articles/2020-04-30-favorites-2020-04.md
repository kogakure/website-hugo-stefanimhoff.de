_Nick Law_, the Vice Chairman of R/GA talks about how it‚Äôs impossible to come up with an idea if you just do collective work in teams:

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúWe talk a lot about the connections, about the collaboration, and this space is built for it, but we‚Äôre also very mindful of these moments we just need to be left the fuck alone and get a clear mind and get laser. And so, there‚Äôs sort of this monkish piece and this sort of social piece and how those things work together is really the tension you‚Äôre dealing with because no one‚Äôs ever come up with a brilliant idea with 30 people in the room. It just doesn‚Äôt happen, you can refine an idea with five people in the room.  But you‚Äôve got to start with this sort of seed and I‚Äôve never seen that seed appear, out of anything but one brain.‚Äù</p>

_Jordan B Peterson_ about how different personalities keep the balance in the society:

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúWhat happened when the Spaniards came to North America? 95% of the Native Americans died. Why? Because the Spaniards brought illness. Smallpox, measles, chickenpox, all these things that the Native Americans had absolutely no resistance to. There were hardly any diseases at all in North and South America. The Spaniards showed up, within 15-20 years, 19 out of 20 of the Native Americans were dead. You never know what people are bringing with them.</p>
  <p>And so what that means is that how should you respond to people who are outside of your circle of familiarity? Well, the answer is: One, they might kill you, in all sorts of ways. Two, they might bring with them things to trade that are of inestimable value. So you‚Äôre stuck. It‚Äôs like, how the hell are you going to reconcile that problem?</p>
  <p>And the answer is, well we reconcile it temperamentally, roughly speaking. So half the people are temperamentally wired up to say, <q>No, no, no! Let‚Äôs keep the damn boxes closed. Took a long time to pack everything in there and to get it into order.</q> And the liberals say, <q>Well wait a minute. You don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve got things in the right boxes, to begin with. The things that you‚Äôre keeping in there were getting stale and old. And maybe we need some new ideas and new people to rejuvenate the situation.</q> That‚Äôs political discussion. And the political discussion has to proceed because there‚Äôs no way of solving that problem except by discussing it.‚Äù</p>
