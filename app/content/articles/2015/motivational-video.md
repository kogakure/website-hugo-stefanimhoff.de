Last week I found a really inspirational film on YouTube, focusing on motivation. It’s a good example of creating something good out of the work of others. The film uses clips and quotes from a broad variaty of people and uses music from movies.

The film <cite>[Why Do We Fall – Motivational Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgmVOuLgFB0)</cite> by <i>Mateusz M</i> is quite successfull and was watched until now over **30 million** times.

The one thing though, which I didn’t like was how the sources where quoted. Just a plain comma-seperated list of people and music out of context, missing where the quote was from or who said it foremost. This post has the aim to fix this.

Sometimes it was hard to find out in which interview exactly a quote was said. If you have more information, please contact me and I’ll update the sources.

## Music

Music is easy, as it was quoted quite good below the film on YouTube:

1. (00:00) Corynorhinus – Hans Zimmer, James Newton Howard (Batman Begins)
2. (01:07) Time – Hans Zimmer (Inception)
3. (03:17) Barbastella – Hans Zimmer, James Newton Howard (Batman Begins)
4. (04:02) Why Do We Fall? – Hans Zimmer (The Dark Knight Rises)
5. (05:23) [Mark Petrie: Polar Shift](https://soundcloud.com/mark-22/polar-shift)

## Quotes

I wrote down the quotes from the different movies, interviews or speeches with as much context as possible. For interviews it was hard to find out, where exactly it was quoted, because most YouTube videos are missing the information.

Additionally I <mark>highlight</mark> the parts used in the film.
