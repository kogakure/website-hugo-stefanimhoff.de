    <h2>Book Lover</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>I love <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/28460819">books</a>, to be precice I love <em>paper</em> books. I can not imagine a living room without shelves of books.</p>
      <p>Most likly I inherited this passion from my grandfather, who owned over <strong>4000</strong> books. My books count roughly a  <strong>1000</strong>. I buy books ahead and my desks are always stuffed with unread books. I like classics, books about philosophy, martial arts, art &amp; desgin, architecture, typography and novels.</p>
      <p>Work-related books I read mostly digital, because they get old too fast and donâ€™t look nice in most cases.</p>
